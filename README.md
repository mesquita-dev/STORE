## üìñ About   

The **STORE** project was a project in which I was able to deepen my knowledge in both design and development. From the search for references to the conception of the **UI design** and the question of the user experience (**UX design**). From that, the design and design system in Figma was created with typography, colors and the design itself. After that, it was passed to development initially using only HTML and CSS and later JavaScript will be implemented
